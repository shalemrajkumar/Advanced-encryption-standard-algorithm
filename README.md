AES algorithm with Cpp and Python
This is c++ based AES algorithm for encrypting input string with a key provided to produce a Cipher text
Fun fact : Even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe............ :)
